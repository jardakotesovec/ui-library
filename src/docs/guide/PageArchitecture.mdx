# Page Architecture

These principles applies for version 3.5 and higher when building new pages or making significant changes to existing ones.

- Using [pinia store](https://pinia.vuejs.org) for state management. Check [vue3 guide](..?path=/docs/guide-vue3--docs#pinia-store) for more details.
- Page and page related components are located in `src/pages` folder
- Not using Smarty template for page itself, template is no part of the vue.js page component. Check out [this guide](../?path=/docs/guide-smarty-vs-vue-js--docs) for more details.
- For styling use TailwindCSS, for more details check out [styling guide](../?path=/docs/guide-style-introduction--docs).

Please checkout [Example Page](../?path=/docs/pages-example-examplepage--docs), which provides well documented boilerplate.
